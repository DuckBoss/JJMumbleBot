        <h2>Server Tools Plugin</h2>
        <p>
        This is a built-in extension plugin that follows the plugin template system. <br>
        The server_tools plugin is an administrative plugin for high-permission users to set callback methods to mumble server events.<br>
        For now, the plugin contains callback events to play an audio clip and send a welcome message when users join the server.<br>
        <b>This is an optional feature, configurable in the plugins' metadata.ini file.</b>
        </p>

        <h3>Usage:</h3>
        <ul>
            <b>Supports generic connection sound clips for all users, and per-user connection sound clips</b>
            <li><code>!setdefaultloginsound 'audio_clip_name'</code>: Sets the generic audio clip that is played when a user joins the server.</li>
            <li><code>!clearloginsound 'username'</code>: Clears the audio clip associated with the given username.</li>
            <li><code>!getloginsound 'username'</code>: Displays the audio clip set to play whenever the given username connects to the server.</li>
            <li><code>!setloginsound 'username' 'audio_clip_name'</code>: Sets the audio clip that will play whenever the given username connects to the server.</li>
