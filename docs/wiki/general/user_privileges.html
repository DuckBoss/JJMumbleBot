        <hr>
        <p>
            <b>Privileges are a way to limit a users usage/access of the bot.</b> <br>
            Some commands in JJMumbleBot are restricted to only administrators of the bot so that regular users may not
            abuse them.
            These commands include blacklisting, whitelisting, quitting the bot, etc.

        <h3>Setting User Privileges</h3>
        <p>
            To modify the user privileges of a user in your mumble server, follow these steps:
        <h4> Manual Method: </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Access the <code>jjmumblebot.db</code> database file located under the cfg directory using a sqlite browsing
                software.
            </li>
            <li>Add the names of mumble users that you want if they don&#39;t already exist to the <code>users</code> table. Set
                their permission levels to whatever level number you wish in the <code>permissions</code> table. Make sure that
                the permission level you choose is a valid permission level from the <code>permission_levels</code> table.
                <br>The default available user privilege levels are:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>BLACKLIST - level 0</code></li>
                    <li><code>DEFAULT - level 1</code></li>
                    <li><code>ELEVATED - level 2</code></li>
                    <li><code>MODERATOR - level 3</code></li>
                    <li><code>ADMINISTRATOR - level 4</code></li>
                    <li><code>SUPER USER- level 5</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Save the file and start the bot.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4> Normal/Command Method: </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>As an administrator or super user, if the user doesn&#39;t already exist in the database, <br>
                use the command: <b>[<code>!addprivileges &#39;username&#39; &#39;level_number&#39;</code>]</b> to add the user to the
                database with the given privilege level.
            <li>As an administrator or super user, <br>
                use the command: <b>[<code>!setprivileges &#39;username&#39; &#39;level_number&#39;</code>]</b> to set an individual user&#39;s
                privilege level. By default, any new users detected by the bot are set to default privilege levels.
        </ol>
        <b>NOTE: Only super users can modify the user privileges of an administrator through the command method.
            Administrators cannot modify another administrator&#39;s user privileges.<br>
            Users may also not modify their own user privileges (so an admin can&#39;t change his user privilege level to
            owner).</b>
        <hr>
        <h3>Checking User Privileges At Runtime</h3>
        There is a command available for checking the user privileges of all the registered users in the database at
        runtime.<br>
        Use <b>[<code>!showprivileges</code>]</b> as an administrator or super user to view the entire list of users and their privilege
        levels.<br>
        This is particularly useful when you need to quickly check a user&#39;s privilege level after modifying it recently.

        <h2>Adding Users To The Blacklist</h2>
        <p>
            There are commands that are used in plugins which you may not want all users to be able to access.<br>For this
            purpose, administrators and owners are able to use the <b>[<code>!blacklistuser &#39;username&#39; &#39;reason&#39;</code>]</b>
            command to blacklist users from using certain commands.<br>
            To add a user to the blacklist, follow these steps:
        <h4>Manual Method:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Access the <code>jjmumblebot.db</code> database file located under the cfg directory using a sqlite browsing
                software.
            </li>
            <li>Add the names of mumble users that you want if they don&#39;t already exist to the <i>users</i> table. Set
                their permission levels to <code>0</code> in the <code>permissions</code> table.
            <li>Save the file and start the bot.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Normal/Command Method:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the <b>[<code>!blacklistuser &#39;username&#39; &#39;reason&#39;</code>]</b> command to blacklist specific users from
                using non-blacklist only commands.<br>You can optionally provide a reason to the blacklist so that the user can
                know why he/she was blacklisted.
            </li>
            For example: <code>!blacklistuser baduser123</code><br>
            This command is equivalent to <b>[<code>!setprivileges &#39;username&#39; 0</code>]</b><br>
            For example, blacklisting with a reason: <code>!blacklistuser baduser123 because you are bad!</code><br>
        </ol>
        <h2> Removing Users From The Blacklist [A.K.A Whitelisting]</h2>
        <p>
        If for whatever reason you want to remove a user from the blacklist, either modify the <code>jjmumblebot.db</code>
        database file manually and change their level to anything but 0. Or use the command <b>[<code>!whitelistuser &#39;username&#39;</code>]</b>.<br>
        For example: <code>!whitelistuser notsobaduser123</code><br>
        This command is equivalent to <b>[<code>!setprivileges &#39;username&#39; 1</code>]</b>
