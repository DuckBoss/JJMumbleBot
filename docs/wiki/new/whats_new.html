            <h3 id="decision">VLC/FFmpeg Updates - A Compromise between functionality and reliability</h3>
            <p>
                I have been working with users of JJMumbleBot to get reliable youtube audio playback and
                finer control over the sound_board plugin with each feature requiring different things.<br>
                For example, being able to trim downloaded audio clips with the <code>!sbdownload</code> command in
                the sound_board plugin required FFmpeg to work.<br>
                However, streaming youtube audio reliably without interruptions or errors required the use
                of VLC. I tried getting FFmpeg to do the job of both but it just wasn't reliable and consistent enough.<br>
                <b>As a result, to get the functionality and features of both worlds I have made VLC and FFmpeg both a requirement for JJMumbleBot
                    to allow future development of more advanced audio processing for audio plugins.</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>VLC and FFmpeg is now a core requirement for JJMumbleBot.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <b>Pros:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Allows future development of advanced audio processing for audio plugins.</li>
                <li>Expands functionality for custom plugins to handle audio data.</li>
                <li>Gives plugin developers more than one choice for an audio library.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Cons:</b><br>
            <ul>
                <li>More requirements = Bigger project size</li>
            </ul>
