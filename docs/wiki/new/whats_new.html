            <h3>Launch Parameters Update -  47 New Launch Parameters!</h3>
            <p>
                With the release of  v4.3.0, I've added ALL the options available in the config.ini file to the launch parameters list.<br/>
                This means that any config option can be overridden on launch!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>-generatecert</code>: Automatically generates a certificate for the bot and updates the config.ini file to include the new certificate path.</li>
                <li>All the options in the config.ini file are not available as launch parameters (47 new launch parameters!)</li>
                <li>For the full list of launch parameters, check the wiki page: <a href="https://duckboss.github.io/JJMumbleBot/wiki/general/command_line_arguments.html">Launch Parameters List</a></li>

            <h3>Docker Builds Support</h3>
            <p>
                I've worked closely with <a href="https://github.com/kaminascripts">@kaminascripts</a> to prepare the JJMumbleBot project for Docker container support.<br/>
                There's a lot to cover about this, but the most important part is that <b>the bot is now easily configurable to run in a docker container.</b><br/>
                For more information and a guide on setting up the bot with Docker, please check the wiki page: <a href="https://duckboss.github.io/JJMumbleBot/wiki/general/docker.html">Docker</a>

            <h3>Other Updates</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A minimally setup config file is now generated if the config.ini file is missing.</li>
                <li>A minimally setup global_aliases file is now generated if the global_aliases.csv file is missing.</li>

                <li>The default values in the config_template.ini have been changed to reflect a minimal config setup  and make it easier for configuration.</li>
                <li>Self-registration in servers is now disabled by default, and can be enabled in the config.ini file (previously it was enabled).</li>
                <li>Logging is now enabled by default, and can be disabled in the config.ini file (previously it was disabled).</li>
                <li>Database backups are disabled by default, and can be enabled in the config.ini fie (previously it was enabled).</li>
                <li>Server_tools plugin's user_connections.csv file generates and is saved in the /cfg/plugins/ folder to improve usability.</li>
                <li>The default multi-command limit set in the config file has been increased to 200.</li>
                <li>The default command queue limit  set in the config file has been increased to 600.</li>

                <li>Moved templates folder out of the cfg folder -> JJMumbleBot/cfg/templates/ folder to JJMumbleBot/templates/</li>
