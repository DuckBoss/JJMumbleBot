## Important Notice To Everyone
One of the main dependencies of this project, and very reputable and widely used package 'youtube-dl' has been removed from Github due to a DMCA takedown.
For more information please refer to the official notice from Github: [Youtube-dl DMCA Notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md)
### How does this impact JJMumbleBot?
JJMumbleBot, as well as every other media bot, uses youtube-dl to interface with youtube and provide downloading/streaming services.
As a result of this DMCA on youtube-dl, youtube-related functions of this bot may stop working in the near future.<br/>

I will continue working on this project, but please be aware that youtube-related commands such as `!link` or `!sbdownload` may stop working.
I will work on solutions to these problems, this notice is to just update everyone on the situation.
### Notice to New Users:
Unfortunately, since youtube-dl is no longer available through it's main distribution channel, in order for this bot to work you will need to have an existing version installed on your computer. 
This means that using the `pip` python command to download the package might not work.

Currently, the youtube-dl download page still works (as of 10/24/2020):
https://youtube-dl.org/

### The Good News:
On the bright side, JJMumbleBot does a LOT more than just streaming youtube content.
As a result, this issue will only affect the media plugin, and specific youtube-related commands in the sound board plugin.
Everything else should continue working as expected.
